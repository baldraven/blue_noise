Polyhedral parallel mesher is an attempt at making a polyhedral and parallel mesher, in 2 steps :
- Massively generating points
- Forming polyhedral cells from those points 

It is planned to use [Honeycomb](https://github.com/LIHPC-Computational-Geometry/honeycomb) for its mesh structure.
It currently only supports 2D.

## Quickstart

You can build and run the project with `Cargo` after cloning the repository:
```
$ cargo run -- --help
```
The help flag will show you all the configuration options.

Default settings will generate Poisson-disk distributed points, in a 10\*10 box, with a minimal distance of 1 between points.
It will then generate a Vorono√Ø diagram using the Jump Flooding Algorithm (with `wgpu`), with resolution 512\*512 pixels, and display the result on a Javascript visualisation.
